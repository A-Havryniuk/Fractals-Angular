      <h2>Fractals in General</h2>
      <p>
        Fractals are fascinating mathematical structures that exhibit intricate patterns at every level of
        magnification.
        They are often created through the repetition of a simple geometric shape or a mathematical equation.

      <h2>Vicheck Fractal</h2>
      <p>
        The Vicheck fractal, though lesser-known, is equally intriguing. It is characterized by its own set of rules and
        equations,
        producing patterns that are different from both the Mandelbrot and Julia fractals.

      <h2>Mandelbrot Fractal</h2>
      <p>
        The Mandelbrot fractal is a well-known and visually stunning fractal that is generated through a simple
        mathematical formula.
        Named after mathematician Beno√Æt B. Mandelbrot, this fractal is famous for its infinite complexity and
        self-similarity.

      <h2>Julia Fractal</h2>
      <p>
        The Julia fractal, named after the French mathematician Gaston Julia, is another mesmerizing fractal with unique
        patterns.
        It is generated using a slightly different mathematical process compared to the Mandelbrot set, resulting in
        distinct and captivating visualizations.
