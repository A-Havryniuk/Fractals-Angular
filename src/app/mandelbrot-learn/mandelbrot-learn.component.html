                    The Mandelbrot set is a famous mathematical set of complex numbers named after the mathematician
                    Beno√Æt B. Mandelbrot, who first introduced it in 1980. The set is generated by iterating a simple
                    mathematical formula and determining, for each point in the complex plane, whether the resulting
                    sequence of numbers remains bounded or diverges to infinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The formula for generating the Mandelbrot set is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, <code>Z</code> is a complex number, <code>C</code> is a constant complex number representing the
                    initial point in the complex plane, and the iteration starts with <code>Z<sub>0</sub> = 0</code>. The set is
                    defined as the collection of all points <code>C</code> for which the iteration remains bounded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set is often represented as the set of complex numbers <code>C</code> for
                    which the sequence <code>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</code> does not diverge as
                    <code>n</code> approaches infinity. In practice, a common approach is to use a maximum number of iterations
                    and consider a point part of the Mandelbrot set if the sequence remains bounded within that limit.

                    The Julia set is another type of fractal, closely related to the Mandelbrot set. Like the Mandelbrot
                    set, it is generated through iterations of a mathematical formula. The formula for the Julia set is
                    similar to the one for the Mandelbrot set but with a fixed complex number as the seed, typically
                    denoted as <code>c</code>. The iteration formula is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Julia set is defined as the collection of complex numbers <code>c</code> for which the iteration does
                    not escape to infinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, given a specific complex number <code>c</code>, the Julia set is the set of all complex
                    numbers <code>z</code> for which the sequence <code>Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</code>
                    remains bounded as <code>n</code> approaches infinity. Much like the Mandelbrot set, the Julia set exhibits
                    intricate and complex fractal patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The visual representation of the Julia set depends on the value of the constant <code>c</code>. Different
                    values of <code>c</code> can result in wildly different Julia sets, each with its own unique fractal
                    structure.
